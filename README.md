## Description

Five Weeks Weather App is complete according to the following criteria: 

* Users have access to a text entry box and a submit button.
* Users can see their search data displayed in two formats, current weather and weather forecast.
* Current weather section shows weather data for the day the search was performed.
* Weather forecast section displays weather data for five upcoming days after search was performed.
* Upon requesting a city, local storage stores an array of city names and a button with the city's name will appear. Users can click on it to request data for that city at any time.

## Usage

If users enter a valid city name into the entry box and then click on Submit, data will be retrieved. The first box next to the first column displays data for current day. There, users can see city name, current date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Under current date box, users can see data up to five days after current data. Days are organized left to right and display date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. After each search, city names become available as buttons. When users click on a city button, information for that city is displayed on the web page. City buttons are also available when the website is accessed again and will remain accessible untill local storage is cleared.
